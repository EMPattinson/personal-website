#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I'm a PhD student in the Dwaipayan Chakrabarti group at UoB, supported by the EPSRC CDT for Topological Design. I'm a chemist by training and I'm currently using that expertise to study atomic liquids, specifically those with anisotropic interactions, looking at the structure of their bonding network and how we can use principles from topology and network science to further our understanding of these liquids and amorphous structures in general!
