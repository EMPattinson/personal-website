## About Me

Hi, I'm a PhD student in the Dwaipayan Chakrabarti group at UoB, supported by the EPSRC CDT for Topological Design. I'm a chemist by training and I'm currently using that expertise to study atomic liquids, specifically those with anisotropic interactions, looking at the structure of their bonding network and how we can use principles from topology and network science to further our understanding of these liquids and amorphous structures in general!
